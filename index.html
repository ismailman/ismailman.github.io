            I've cofounded two startups. The most recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.streak.com">Streak.com</a> went through 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ycombinator.com">YC</a> in Summer of 2011 and is now 
            generating millions in revenue a year and has a team of 35 fantastic people. 
            Hopefully one day it will be a multi-billion dollar company.
        </p>
        <p>
            I left Streak in March of 2019. After 14 years of "The Founder Life" I decided
            to move back to my home town of Waterloo, Ontario and spend more time with family.

            I'm still figuring out exactly what I want to do, but it should leverage the experience 
            I've gained over the past decade and a half, this includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>10+ years of intense performance focused Javascript engineering. I've personally written hundreds of thousands of lines of JS code.</li>
            <li>Taking a project from idea to production. I've launched hundreds of features.</li>
            <li>General software engineering. Have experience with 20+ languages, strong with datastructures and algorithms.</li>
            <li>Mentoring junior engineers. Done this half a dozen times.</li>
            <li>Developing a technical hiring process. Helped grow team to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.streak.com/teams/engineering">12 engineers</a>.</li>
            <li>Interviewing engineers. Conducted literally hundreds of phone interviews and close to a hundred onsites.</li>            
            <li>Other stuff. A lot of system architecture, product ideation, and user analysis over the years.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
