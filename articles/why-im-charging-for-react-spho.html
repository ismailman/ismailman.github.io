    <h1>Why I'm Charging for React SPHO</h1>
    <p>I recently developed an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ismailman/react-spho">animation library called
            React SPHO</a>, and in contrast to many libraries I chose to use a dual license approach. That is, <a
            href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ismailman/react-spho">React SPHO</a> is free to use in your own open
        source project, but if you’re going to use it for commercial purposes then you need a paid license. Given that
        charging for an open source library is pretty rare I knew that I would get some pushback from developers, so
        hopefully this essay addresses those concerns.</p>

    <p>The reason I’m charging for commercial usage is that I’m an individual developer that loves to code, and I want
        to make money by coding.</p>

    <p>I don’t want to make money by selling support, or training, or swag. </p>

    <p>I don’t want to beg for donations. </p>

    <p>I’m not part of a company that is releasing a project for hiring or marketing purposes.</p>

    <p>I’m not trying to use the library to find a job or gain personal notoriety.</p>

    <p>I want to get paid writing code, that I want to write, that provides value to companies.</p>

    <p>If React SPHO provides value to companies and saves developers some time and money, then it’s entirely reasonable
        to be paid for that.</p>

    <p>I’ve also structured the costs to be in “no-brainer” territory. It’s a one-time fee for perpetual use of the
        library and all subsequent improvements. The cost for a commercial license is dependent on how much money your
        company is making:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>$50 for companies that are making less than $100,000 USD/year.</li>

        <li>$100 for companies that are making between $100K and $1M/year</li>

        <li>$250 for companies that are making between $1M and $5M/year</li>

        <li>$500 for companies that are making between $5M and $10M/year</li>

        <li>$1000 for companies that are making over $10M/year</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At these prices it will cost your company <strong>more</strong> just to have the meeting about whether or not
        it’s worth paying for a commercial license than to just buy it.</p>

    <p>Will companies actually pay for <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ismailman/react-spho">React SPHO</a>? I
        guess we’ll find out, but I honestly believe it is the easiest to use animation library for UIs built in React.
    </p>

    <p>If you’re a developer reading this and don’t want to pay for software, just know that you’re cutting your own
        throat. As developers it will be a better world for us if more of us can make a good living by writing open
        source code as individuals not tied to any company.</p>

    <p>Now go check out <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ismailman/react-spho">React SPHO</a> and make your UIs
        more fluid and organic with very little work.</p>
